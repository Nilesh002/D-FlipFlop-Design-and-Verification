This SystemVerilog testbench verifies the functionality of a D Flip-Flop (DFF) using a structured verification approach similar to UVM (Universal Verification Methodology). The testbench consists of multiple components, including a generator, driver, monitor, scoreboard, and environment, to ensure proper functionality.

Key Features
Structured verification approach: Uses an object-oriented methodology with class-based components.
Randomized stimulus generation: The generator creates random input patterns for verification.
Automated checking: The scoreboard compares expected vs. actual output.
Separation of testbench components: Improves reusability and modularity.
